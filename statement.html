  	<p>As an Iranian woman my distress and passion is always about women and society. I have dedicated all my work to it and have faced a lot of problems in my own country, as Islamic law puts a lot of limitations on my subject, I felt I could not paint what I wanted and could not say what I wanted as I am an independent artist. In addition to this, I wanted to study in a city and society where art is deeply ingrained. As I understand that I need to know about criticism and theory as well as practical areas whilst keeping in mind  all of my restraints in Iran as an independent woman painter who has her point of view on femininity I searched for a city where I could express myself and progress as an artist. My search brought me here to London to discover and study art in a free and academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>I am a painter who has had to deal with lots of restrictions during her professional artistic life and who hopes that, through this phase in her education, she can attain an international knowledge in a rigorous university, besides experiencing freedom in her work and being able to paint what she really wants and talk about her real thoughts with respect to her interpretation of femininity in her society.</p>
<p>I want to pursue my subject, which is women, society and femininity, at a higher level.  I wish to highlight the role of art in representing Middle Eastern women who often have no voice. With these aims in mind, I need to research and develop a broad comparative knowledge of contemporary art in Eastern and Western societies, including critical and theoretical approaches in the West.</p>
